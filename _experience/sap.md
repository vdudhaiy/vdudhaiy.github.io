I was a Data Science Developer Intern at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/sea/index.html) Singapore working in the Personalized Recommendations team. My work involved performing several benchmarking experiments pertaining to training and finetuning foundational models for PR.
 
My experience as an intern allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the AI, and I learnt so much more about Generative AI, LLMs, neural networks, deep learning, and recommendation models.

I was able to enhance several key skills such as PyTorch, Python programming, LangChain, prompt engineering, data analysis, data science, and technical documentation. 

I also had the opportunity to participate in the GenAI Hackathon organized by SAP Labs, which allowed me to put my newly learnt skills to the test. All ideas were voted upon internally and our idea was ranked in the top 13% of ideas submitted globally.
