I've had the pleasure of working at the [Helen Bass Williams Academic Success Center (ASC)](https://www.purdue.edu/asc/) at Purdue since September 2023. 

During my time at the ASC, I've fulfilled several roles:

## Senior Leader <small> (Fall 2025 - Spring 2026) </small>
As a Senior Leader within the SI program, I support the development and success of peer leaders through mentorship, training facilitation, and collaborative leadership. I serve as a liaison between student leaders and professional staff, review and provide feedback on session plans, observe and evaluate sessions. The overall objective is to cultivate a positive and inclusive team culture. I also contribute to project planning and implementation, lead team meetings, and support recruitment and onboarding of new student leaders within the Academic Succes Center.

## Reflection Group Leader <small> (Spring 2025) </small>
As a Reflection Group Leader, I helped create and implement initiatives and education meant to develop a group of SI leaders - referred to as a reflection group. I served as a guide and mentor that strived to create a welcoming atmosphere, a cohesive and communicative group, fostered individual and group skill development, and served as a liaison between leaders and professional staff.

## Supplemental Instruction Leader for MA 16020 <small> (Fall 2023 - Fall 2025) </small>
I served as the Supplemental Instruction Leader for MA 16020 (Applied Calculus II). As an SI Leader, I held 3 sessions and an office hour every week of the semester where I facilitated group-learning through fun, collaborative activities that improved understanding of challenging concepts.
